- Provides validation for the date of birth field, ensuring that the day number is between 1-31, the month number is between 1-12, the year is not in the future, and the date is valid (e.g., February 29 is only valid for leap years).
- Provides an optimal layout for the interface depending on the device's screen size.
- Provides hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Provides a bonus feature that animates the age numbers to their final number when the form is submitted.
